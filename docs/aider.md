# Installing Aider

Aider really want to be installed via pip, so the easiest way to install it is to use pipx.

```bash
pipx install aider-install
aider-install
```

This will install aider in a virtual environment in `~/.local/pipx/venvs/aider-install` and will install the `aider` command in your path.
